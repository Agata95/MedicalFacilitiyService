                    1877, Saint Joseph Hospital was Lexingtonâ€™s first hospital and serves residents of central and
                    eastern Kentucky.

                    care community. Saint Joseph has also been nationally recognized for treatment in the areas of

                    The medical staff of the hospital was chosen among reputable specialists with long-term experience
                    in their specialization: surgeons, orthopaedists, gynaecologists, laryngologists - who mostly have

                <p class="lead" align="justify">We are aware of the fact that for the full and quick recovery, besides
                    the top quality
                    diagnosis and treatment, it is extremely important to develop a good relationship with Patients and
                    that is why each one of them is treated uniquely. The date of the medical intervention will be fixed
                    individually by the doctor together with the Patient. It will be possible then to choose the most
                    convenient date. We have set up a separate info line specifically for the Patients of the new
                    hospital. The hospital has single and double rooms, both types comfortably equipped with individual
                    bathrooms, TV sets and internet connection.

                <p class="lead" align="justify">
                    The Patients can be assisted by their families throughout the entire stay at the hospital. Children
                    can be accompanied by their parents even into the operating room until the moment of narcosis, in
                    order to reduce stress.

                    During their stay at the hospital the Patients can use the free-of-charge parking lot.
